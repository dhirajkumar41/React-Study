Why React instead of vanilla javascript to build web applications? (vanilla means basic or pure. vanilla javascript means pure javacript)

1. React is faster than vanilla javascript
  - React uses virtual dom which helps it to work faster

2. Reusable web components 
   - we can build react components and resuse them in our code
   - Ex. Bootstrap navbar, in reality it has 20-30 lines of code but we can create a react components out of it and reuse it anywhere in our code.
    like 
        <body>
           <!-- Below is the bootstrap navbar component -->
          <thisIsOurBootstrapNavbar />  
        </body>
        
3. React is maintained by Facebook, so its latest technology and very popular.
