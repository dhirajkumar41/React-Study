Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where a virtual representation of UI is kept in memory
and synced with real dom. This process is called reconciliation. 


You tell React what state you want the UI to be in, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state. 
This abstracts out the attribute manipulation, event handling, and manual DOM updating that you would 
otherwise have to use to build your app.


Is the Shadow DOM the same as the Virtual DOM?

No, they are different. The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables 
and CSS in web components. The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.


What is “React Fiber”?

Fiber is the new reconciliation engine in React 16. Its main goal is to enable incremental rendering of the virtual DOM
